# Python_Selenium_WebScrapping-
I will be completing some task that were given to me as an assignment to do web scrapping using selenium in Python language

-> Task 3 is not uploaded as it required some minor addition to code of task 2. So in task 2, task 3 is also done
-> [For future reference] Task 8 and Task 9 will give error and not work properly as the html path of the objects are incorrect as the website has been updated overtime and the developer has changed the html XPATH
